                        <div class="list-item">Advantages
                            <p><span class="large-bullet">&#9642;</span>High Designability: superconducting qubits, including charge qubits, flux qubits, and phase qubits,
                                offer a high level of design flexibility.
                            </p>
                            <p><span class="large-bullet">&#9642;</span>Scalability: superconducting qubits are prepared using semiconductor microfabrication
                                processes, allowing for the leveraging of advanced chip-making technologies and the
                                production of high-quality devices.</p>
                            <p><span class="large-bullet">&#9642;</span>Easy to couple: superconducting qubits can be efficiently coupled using either capacitance
                                or inductance, providing ease in creating interactions between qubits.</p>
                            <p><span class="large-bullet">&#9642;</span>Easy to control: microwave control is compatible with the measurement of superconducting qubits,
                                simplifying the control measurements.</p>

                            <p><span class="large-bullet">&#9642;</span>Short coherence time: decoherence time in superconducting qubits can be limited, impacting
                                stability and reliability of quantum information processing.</p>
                            <p><span class="large-bullet">&#9642;</span>Qubits not true 2-level systems: other unrelated quantum states exist, introducing complexities in their interactions.</p>
                            <p><span class="large-bullet">&#9642;</span>Low temperature and advanced cryostats: Operating at sufficient low temperature, often close to absolute zero, is
                                a requirement for superconducting qubits. The use of advanced cryostats maintains the condition of quantum coherence.</p>
