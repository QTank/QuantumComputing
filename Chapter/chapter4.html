            <h2>Chapter 4 Quantum Algorithm</h2>
            <p>In quantum computing, a quantum algorithm is an algorithm which runs on a realistic model
                of quantum computation, the most commonly used model being the quantum circuit model of computation<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_algorithm">[1]</a>.
                In the quantum circuit model, various quantum gates are the fundamental building block to manipulate
                the quantum states of qubits and perform computations. These gates operate on qubits in superposition,
                which allows them to process multiple inputs simultaneously. This is different from classical circuits,
                where gates operate on classical bits (0 or 1) and can only process one input at a time. Quantum gates can
                be combined in various ways to create quantum circuits that execute specific quantum algorithms. The ability
                to process multiple inputs through superposition and exploit entanglement is what gives quantum computers their
                potential for exponential speedup over classical computers for certain task.</p>
            <p>Quantum algorithm can be catagorized into two types, full quantum circuits and hybrid classical-quantum algorithms.
                In full quantum circuits, the entire algorithm is executed on a quantum computer using quantum gates. With quantum algorithms,
                full quantum circuits require a large number of qubits and gates to achieve a specific function. However, the number of qubits is limited
                in a real quantum computer. In addition, the quantum gate fidelity is not high and current quantum circuits suffer from high quantum errors. It is challenging
                to achieve a quantum algorithm with a large number of quantum gates. Also, quantum circuits often require qubits
                to interact with each other through two-qubit gates. However, qubit connectivity is limited because of the physical layout
                of the qubits and the limitations of the underlying hardware architecture. Some quantum circuits can not be executed efficiently so
                quantum optimization technology can reduce the effects of limited qubit connectivity. It converts a quantum circuit to an equivalent circuit
                which can be efficiently executed on the available quantum hardware.</p>
            <p>Hybrid classical quantum algorithms are combining classical and quantum components to achieve a specific function. Because of the limitations,
                such as gate fidelity and coherence time, these algorithms can reduce these limitations by offloading
                certain computations to classical processors. It aims to efficiently and explicitly execute a quantum algorithm
                in the current condition. Another reason is that some functions can be easy to be completed in a classical computer but extremely difficult in a quantum one.
                Using classical part will simply the complex of quantum algorithms. For example, finding the lowest energy is difficult in quantum hardware
                so a classical optimization is executed using gradient descent algorithm.</p>
