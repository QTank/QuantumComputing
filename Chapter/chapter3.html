			<h2>Quantum Bit</h2>
			<p>In classical computing, a bit is the fundamental unit of information and the basic building block of digital data. A bit can represent one of two states, typically expressed as 0 or 1. Electronic devices, such as transistors in computer circuits, can easily build two states(high/low voltage), making it a natural choice for encoding information in digital systems. The manipulation of bits forms the foudation of digital computation and information processing in classical computers</p>
			<p>In quantum computing, a quantum bit is the fundamental unit of quantum informationin quantum computing, also called qubit. Unlike classical bits which can only be certain in a state of 0 or 1, a qubit posseses the unique property of existing in both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This property is called as superposition. Upon measurement, the superposition collapses, and the qubit takes on a definte state either 0 or 1. The outcome is probablisstic, introducing an element of uncertainty. The probablities assigned during the superpostion influence the likelihood of the qubit collapsing into either state.</p>
			
			<p>In quantum information theory, a quantum state is noted as |\(\psi\)>. The quantum state 0 is noted as |0>, and the quantum state 1 is noted as |1>. The quantum state 0 and 1 can be represented as a vector, such as 
	|0> = \(\begin{pmatrix}
			1 \\
			0
			\end{pmatrix}\) 
and |1| = \(\begin{pmatrix}
			0\\
			1
			\end{pmatrix} \).
A qubit can be represented by a line superpostion of two elementary orthogonal states |0> and |1>:</p>

			<p id="eq1">\[|\psi> = \alpha|0> + \beta|1> = \alpha \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\
            0
            \end{pmatrix} + \beta \begin{pmatrix}
            0 \\
            1
            \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
            \alpha \\
            \beta
            \end{pmatrix}\]</p>
			<p>The two coordinates \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are called qubit amplitudes. A measurement is not deterministic, but the total probabilites of all quantum states are certain to equal 1. When a qubit system is measured, the probability of yielding the quantum state 0 equals \(|\alpha|^{2}\), and that of yielding the quantum state 1 equals \(|\beta|^{2}\). Therefore we have</p> 
			<p>\[|\alpha|^{2} + |\beta|^{2} = 1\]</p>

			<p>In a multi-qubit system, the state of the entire system is described by the combined quantum states of each qubit. The state of the n-qubit system is represented as a linear combination of basis states. In a 2-qubit system, the basis state |00>, |01>, |10>, and |11> can be denoted as a vector:</p>
			<p>\[|00> = \begin{pmatrix}
            1 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            \end{pmatrix}, |01> = \begin{pmatrix}
            0 \\
            1 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            \end{pmatrix}, |10> = \begin{pmatrix}
            0 \\
            0 \\
            1 \\
            0 \\
            \end{pmatrix}, |11> = \begin{pmatrix}
            0 \\
            0 \\
            0 \\
            1 \\
            \end{pmatrix} \]</p> 



A qubit in a 2-qubit system can be in a superposition of four basis states:</p>
			<p>\[|\psi> = \alpha_{00}|00> + \alpha_{01}|01> + \alpha_{10}|10> + \alpha_{11}|11> = \begin{pmatrix}
            \alpha_{00} \\
            \alpha_{01} \\
            \alpha_{10} \\
            \alpha_{11} \\
            \end{pmatrix}\]</p>
			<p>Here, \(\alpha_{00}, \alpha_{01}, \alpha_{10}\), and \(\alpha_{11}\) are quantum amplitudes of |00>, |01>, |10>, and |11>,</p>

			<p>\[|\alpha_{00}|^{2} + |\alpha_{01}|^{2} + |\alpha_{10}|^{2} + |\alpha_{11}|^{2} = 1\]</p>

			<h2>Quantum Logic Gates</h2>
			<p>Quantum logic Gates, also called quantum gates, are fundamental components in the field of quantum computing. Similar to classical gates, quantum gates are building for constructing quantum circuits. These gates manipulate quantum bits, from one quantum state \(|\psi>\) to another state \(|\psi'>\). For example, a quantum gate called U, and the relation between the input quantum state and output state can be expressed </p>
			<p>\[|\psi'> = U|\psi>\]</p>
			<p>Here, the quantum state \(|\psi>\) and \(|\psi'>\) are both a unitary vetor so the U is a unitaroy operator, which is the most imporant property of quantum gates. Please note it.

			<h2>Quantum Circuits</h2>
			<p>Quantum circuit is a computation model that utilizes a combination of quantum gates to perform quantum operations on qubits. Quantum gates manipulate the quantum state of input qubits, leading to a final state that represents the computation's outcome. These outcomes are probabilistic so requires multiple measurements are required to obtain final results. One property of quantum circuits is reversiblility. This arises from the fact that each quantum gate is unitary, imply that the input state can be recovered from the output qubits using some unitary gates. The nature of quantum gates ensures that the evolution of the quantum state is traceable in both forward and backward directions.</p>

				<p><b>Quantum circuit for bell states</b></p>
				<p>A Bell state, also called as an entangled state or EPR pair(Einsten-Podolsky-Rosen pair), is a specific
					entangled quantum states of two qubits. John Bell introduced Bell inequalities that was designed to test
					the entangled part of the property of quantum mechanics. The Bell states can be constructed through
					the quantum circuits as follows. When some entanged qubits are prepared, the Bell quantum circuit can be applied into customed quantum circuits.

				<p>When the input qubit |q0> = |0> and |q1> = |0>, </p>
				<div>
					\[

					\]
				</div>
				<p>The output qubit is \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00> + |11>)\)</p>
				<p>In fact, there are four types of Bell states. Another three types as follows:</p>
				<div>
					\[
						\beta_{01} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01> + |10>) \\
						\beta_{10} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|00> - |11>) \\
						\beta_{11} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|01> - |10>)

					<p>It means that the input qubits are |01>, |10> and |11> respectively in the quantum circuit above.</p>

			<p><b>Quantum full adder</b></p>

			<p>The add cirucit use CNOT and CCNOT circuits so it is important to know the output state of the target qubit of CNOT and CCNOT.</p>
			<p>CNOT gate acts on two qubits, A as control qubit and B as target qubit. </p>
			<p>The output state of CNOT = \(|A>|A \oplus B>\)</p>
			<p>	It is easy to verify it through true table.
				When A is |0> as control qubit, the output of B(target qubit) is unchanged.
				When A is |1> as control qubit, the output state of B(target qubit) flips.
				Therefore, the output state of target is XOR between the state of A and B.
			</p>
			<p>CCNOT gate acts on three qubits, A and B as control qubits and C as target qubit.</p>
			<p>The output state of CCNOT = \(|(A \cdot B) \oplus C>\)</p>
			<p>We can see A and B as one qubit(\(A \cdot B\)) to control the target qubit so it is the same as CNOT gate.</p>

			<p>The quantum circuit of full adder as follows:</p>
			<img src="../fig/Adder.png" id="centerImg">
			<p>We derive the math expression of \(C_{out}\) and S seperately. </p>
			<p></p>
			<div>In the stage 1,
				\[
					\begin{align}
					|S> &= |C_{in}> \\
					|A'> &= |A> \\
					|B'> &= |B> \\
					|C_{out}> &= |(AB) \oplus 0> = |AB>
					\end{align}
				\]
			</div>
			<div>
				In the state 2,
				\[
					\begin{align}
					|S> &= |C_{in}> \\
					|A'> &= |A> \\
					|B'> &= |A \oplus B> \\
					|C_{out}> &= |(AB) \oplus 0> = |AB>
					\end{align}
				\]
			</div>
			<div>
				In the stage 3,
				\[
					\begin{align}
					|S> &= |C_{in}> \\
					|A'> &= |A> \\
					|B'> &= |A \oplus B> \\
					|C_{out}> &= |AB \oplus [C_{in} \cdot (A \oplus B)]>
					\end{align}
				\]

				In the stage 4,

					\begin{align}
					|S> &= |C_{in} \oplus A \oplus B> \\
					|A'> &= |A> \\
					|B'> &= |A \oplus B> \\
					|C_{out}> &= |AB \oplus [C_{in} \cdot (A \oplus B)]>
					\end{align}

				In the final stage,
					\begin{align}
					|S> &= |C_{in} \oplus A \oplus B> \\
					|A'> &= |A> \\
					|B'> &= |A \oplus B> \\
					|C_{out}> &= |AB \oplus [C_{in} \cdot (A \oplus B)]>
					\end{align}
				<p>From the equation above, we can see the expression state of |S> equals the math one of S of a full adder.</p>

				<p>However, the expression of \(C_{out}\) is different from the one of a full adder. We can simply the expression to verify that they are the same one.</p>
				<div>
					\[
						\begin{align}
							|C_{out}> &= |AB \oplus [C_{in} \cdot (A \oplus B)]>
						\end{align}
					\]
					We can use X represents \(A \oplus B\), then


					\[
						\begin{align}

							|C_{out}> &= |AB \oplus [C_{in} \cdot X]> \\
									  &= |AB \overline{C_{in}X} + \overline{AB} C_{in}X>\\
									  &= |AB(\overline{C_{in}} + \overline{X}) + (\overline{A}+\overline{B})C_{in}X> \\
									  &= |AB(\overline{C_{in}} + \overline{A\oplus B}) + (\overline{A}+\overline{B})C_{in}\overline{A\oplus B})> \\
									  &= |AB(\overline{C_{in}} + AB + \overline{A}\overline{B}) + (\overline{A}+\overline{B})(A\overline{B} + \overline{A}B)C_{in}> \\
									  &= |AB\overline{C_{in}} + AB + (A\overline{B} + \overline{A}B)C_{in}> \\
									  &= |AB + (A\overline{B} + \overline{A}B)C_{in}> \\
									  &= |AB + (A\oplus B) \cdot C_{in}>
						\end{align}

					\]
					<p>We can see the expression of \(|C_{out}>\) equals the \(C_{out}\) of a full adder.
						Therefore, the quantum full adder circuit can have the function of adding two qubits with carry.</p>

			<p>For example, before we use the quantum full adder, we need to prepare the input qubit for
				the value we want to compute. For example, when A = 0, B = 0, Cin = 1 and A = 1, B = 1, Cin = 1, we need
				to design quantum circuit to satisfy the condition. I used qiskit simulator to make
				the quantum circuit and got the measurement outcome of the circuit. The quantum circuit as follows:</p>
			<img src="../fig/adder_preparation_qiskit1.png" id="centerImg">

			<img src="../fig/adder_preparation_qiskit2.png" id="centerImg">
			<p>The first qubit |q0> is Cin, the second |q2> and third qubits |q3> are A and B, the last qubit |q4> is |0> as the input qubits.
				We prepared input quantum states, one is |A> = |B> = |0>,  |Cin> = |1>, and the other is |A> = |B> = |1>, |Cin> = |1>.
				In Qiskit, note the first qubit is the rightest one in the figure.
				The outcome in the figure is |0001> with the probability with 677/1024, and |0111> with 347/1024.

			</p>

			<img src="../fig/adder_qiskit2.png" id="centerImg">
			<p>In the figure, from the right to left, the first qubit of the final result is the sum of A and B, the second and third one are A and B,
				and the last one is the carry. </p>
			<p>In the figure, |0001> represents the carry is 0 and the sum of A and B is 1 when A = B = 0, and Cin = 1.
				Its probability is 653/1024 which is close to 677/1024.
				|1111> represents the carray is the carry is 1 and the sum of A and B is 1 when A = B = 1, and Cin = 1.
				Its probability is 371/1024 which is close to 647/1024.
				It means that the quantum circuit can perform the function of a full adder.
