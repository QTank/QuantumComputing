			<h2>1.1 What is Quantum computer?</h2>
                <p>A quantum computer is a machine built on the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations.
                The concept of quantum computing was first proposed by Richard Feynman, who recognized that a quantum
                computer could effectively simulate the behaviour of quantum systems - a task that classical computers
                struggle with. Feynman's idea arose from the inherent difficulties classical computers faced in modeling
                complex quantum phenomena. As researchers attempted to simulate increasingly intricate quantum systems,
                the limitations of classical computers became apparent. Feynman suggested that a quantum computer, leveraging
                the unique properties of quantum mechanics, could perform these simulations more efficiently. His proposal
                laid the foundation for the field of quantum computing.</p>

            <p>Since then, various type of quantum computers have been developed, and researchers continue to explore
            the potential of quantum computing by designing quantum algorithms that can solve certain problems faster than
            classical ones. The pursuit of practical quantum computing is driven by its potential impact on fields such as
            optimization, chemistry, biology, cryptography, and beyond.</p>

            <p><b>DiVincenzo Criteria</b></p>
            <p>DiVincenzo Criteria outlined five essential criteria for implementing quantum computation in 2000 <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0002077">[1]</a>.
                These criteria provide a framework for the implementation of quantum information processing and ensure for reliable quantum computation.
                Two additional criteria (6 and 7) are used for quantum communication.

            <ul>
                <li><b>1. A scalable physical system with well characterized qubits.</b>
                    <p>A qubit is a fundamental block of quantum computing, representing a quantum two-level system that can exist two states (denoted as |0> and |1>). These states can correspond to different physical systems, such as two spin states of a spin 1/2 particle, or the ground and excited states of an atom.
                    These qubits are well-defined, so it means that their states can be precisely controlled and measured. These precise control is key for ensuring the qubit behaves predictably in a quantum system.</p>
                </li>
                <li><b>2. The ability to initialize the state of the qubits to a simple fiducial state, such as |000...>.</b>
                    <p>It is important to initialize the qubits to a specific state before executing quantum computations.
                    This initialization typically sets all qubits to the state |0>, creating a well-defined starting point. It ensures
                    that the quantum algorithm begins with a clean state. </p>

            <p><b>1.2.1 Superconducting Quantum Computers</b></p>
<!--                <p>How to prepare quantum bits on superconducting</p>-->

                <p>Superconducting quantum computers rely on superconducting circuits to manipulate quantum bits. It utilizes
                    superconducting materials, which exhibit zero electrical resistance at a temperature around absolute zero.
                    Superconducting qubits are typically created using devices called Josephson Junctions, which are key components
                    in quantum computers.
                    Quantum bits can be prepared by Josephson Junctions. The Josephson Junction is a device in superconductivity that consists of two superconductors separated by a thin
                    insulating or non-superconducting barrier. The key feature of the Josephson Junction is to allow
                    supercurrent to flow across the barrier. The quantum phenomenon can be observed in Josephson junctions. </p>

            <p><b>Josephson Junctions</b></p>
                <p>A Josephson Junction consists of two superconductors separated by a thin insulating or non-superconducting barrier.
                The unique property of this junction is that it allows a supercurrent to flow across the barrier without any voltage applied.
                This quantum phenomenon is essential for the function of superconducting qubits.</p>
                <p></p>
            <p><b>Types of superconducting qubits</b></p>
                <img src="../fig/superconducting-qubit.png" id="centerImg">
                <p>There are three types of superconducting quantum qubits, charge qubit, flux qubit, and phase qubit, where U represents a voltage, Cg represents a capacitance,
                    L represents an inductance, \(I_{0}\) represents a current, and \(E_{J}\) represents a Josephson junction.</p>


            <p><b>1. Charge Qubits</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Charge qubits are sensitive to the number of Cooper pairs (pairs of electrons with opposite spins)
                on a superconducting island.</li>
                <li><b>Transmon qubit</b>: A widely used variant of the charge qubit, the transmon qubit improves coherence
                time and control by reducing sensitivity to charge noise. It maintains a large energy difference between
                its ground and excited states, making it stable at operating temperature.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>2. Flux Qubits</b></p>
            <ul><li>Flux qubits are based on the quantization of magnetic flux in a superconducting loop. The quantum state
                corresponds to the direction of the circulating current within the loop.</li></ul>
            <p><b>3. Phase Qubits</b></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Phase qubits use the phase difference across a Josephson Junction as the quantum variable. These qubits
                are controlled by applying microwave pulses to induce transitions between quantum states.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Advantages of superconducting qubits</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>High Designability</b>: Superconducting qubits, including charge, flux, and phase qubits, offer a
                high degree of flexibility in their design, allowing for tailored qubit properties.</li>
                <li><b>Scalability</b>: Superconducting qubits are fabricated using advanced semiconductor microfabrication
                processes, enabling the production of high-quality devices and potential scalability for large quantum systems.</li>
                <li><b>Ease of Coupling</b>: Superconducting qubits can be coupled efficiently using capacitance or inductance, facilitating
                the creation of interactions between qubits necessary for quantum computers.</li>
                <li><b>Ease of Control</b>: Superconducting qubits are compatible with microwave control, simplifying
                the processes of qubit manipulation </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Challenges of Superconducting Qubits</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Short Coherence Time</b>: The coherence time of superconducting qubits is limited, which impacts
                the stability and reliability of quantum information processing.</li>
                <li><b>Non-ideal Two-Level Systems</b>: Superconducting qubits are not perfect two-level systems, as they
                can interact with other quantum states, leading to complexities in their behaviour.</li>
                <li><b>Low Temperatures</b>: Superconducting qubits operate at temperatures close to absolute zero, requiring
                the use of advanced cryostats to maintain quantum coherence.</li>
