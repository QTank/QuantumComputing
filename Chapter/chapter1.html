			<h2>1.1 What is Quantum computer?</h2>
			<p>Quantum computer is a machine constructed based on the principles of quantum mechanics
                to perform computations. Richard Feynman fisrt proposed the idea that a quantum computer,
                based on the principles of quantum mechanics, could effectively simulate the behaviour
                of quantum systems. The original motivation behind Feynman's proposal arised from the
                inherent challenges classical computers faced in modeling quantum systems.
                The limitations of classical computers became increasingly evident as researchers sought to
                simulate complex quantum phenomena. Feynman suggested the concept of quantum computer,
                designed to utilize the unique properties of quantum mechanics to perform simulations
                more effectively. His proposal laid the groundwork for the field of quantum computing.
                Various types of quantum computers have been built and researchers are exporing the
                development of quantum computers, designing quantum algorithms for solving certain problems
                faster than classical one. The pursuit of practical quantum computing is fueled by the
                potential to fields such as optimization, cryptography, etc. </p>

            <p>Quantum computers are caregorized into different types based on the physical qubits.
                Common types include superconducting quantum computers, trapped-ion quantum computers, semiconductor quantum computers
                topoligical quantum computers, quantum annealers, and photonic quantum computers.

            <p><b>1.2.1 Superconducting quantum computers</b></p>
<!--                <p>How to prepare quantum bits on superconducting</p>-->

                <p>Superconducting quantum computers rely on superconducting circuits to manipulate quantum bits. It utilizes
                    superconducting materials, which has zero resistance around absolute zero temperature. Quantum bits can be prepared
                    by Josephson Junctions. The Josephson Junction is a device in superconductivity that consists of two superconductors separated by a thin
                    insulating or non-superconducting barrier. The key feature of the Josephson Junction is to allow
                    supercurrent to flow across the barrier. The quantum phenomenon can be observed in Josephson junctions. </p>
                <p></p>

                <img src="../fig/superconducting-qubit.png" id="centerImg">

                <p>There are three types of superconducting quantum qubits, charge qubit, flux qubit, and phase qubit, where U represents a voltage, Cg represents a capacitance,
                    L represents an inductance, \(I_{0}\) represents a current, and \(E_{J}\) represents a Josephson junction.</p>
                <p>Transmon qubit is the most common one of the charge qubit. It is a variation of the original Cooper pair box qubit,
                    improving coherence and properties and easier control. One key feature is the energy difference between the qubit's ground
                    and excited states is much larger than the thermal energy at the operating temperature. In addition,
                    it has less noise and long coherence times. </p>
