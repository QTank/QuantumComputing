            <h2>Protein Folding</h2>
            <p>Protein folding is the physical process by which a polypeptide chain produces a three-dimensional structure.
                It involves primary structure, secondary structure, tertiary structure, and quaternary structure.
                The structure of a protein is crucial for its functions, as it determines how the protein interacts with other molecules in the cell.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary structure: The linear sequence of amino acids join together, which is determined by the genetic code in DNA. </li>
                <li>Secondary structure: The structures, such as alpha helices and beta sheets, are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the backbone atoms of amino acids.</li>
                <li>Tertiary structure: It arises from the folding of secondary structure elements and interactions between amino acids. </li>
                <li>Quaternary structure: multiple proteins fold into a larger and functional protein.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here, I explore the utilization of quantum algorithms for protein folding into tertiary structures.
                Protein folding involves predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence,
                with the goal of finding the conformation with the minimum energy. To address this challenge, I employ Variational
                Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) that can efficiently approximate the ground state energy of quantum systems. By leveraging
                VQE, I aim to advance our understanding of protein folding and contribute to the development of novel computational
                approaches in structural biology. </p>

            <p>Due to the limited number of qubits available on current quantum computers, executing quantum protein folding becomes
                challenging for longer amino acid sequences. This limitation constrains the size and complexity of the protein structures
                that can be accurately modeled with quantum algorithms. As a result, while quantum computing holds promise for advancing
                protein folding research, overcoming hardware constrains remains a critical challenge that requires further exploration and
                innovation.</p>

            <p>Simplifying protein folding on a diamond lattice provides a foundational framework to illustrate quantum approaches for studying
                protein folding. In this simplified model, proteins are represented as linear chains of amino acids arranged on a lattice resembling the crystalline
                structure of diamond. Each amino acid is positioned at a lattice site, and the connections between them mimic the bonds in the protein backbone.
                Importantly, the angle and distance of amino acids are constrained by the lattice structure, reflecting the geometric limitations imposed by the lattice
                geometric. It can be allowed to investigate quantum approaches for protein folding processes.</p>

            <p>The quantum method described in the reference [1] encodes the directions of two adjacent amino acids on a lattice model as turns, which involves the relative orientation or angular displacement between the amino acids.
                In the simplified diamond model, the connections between lattice sites represent the bonds between adjacent amino acids in the protein chain.
                All of amino acids are positioned at either the sub-lattice A or B in the Figure 1 (a) and (b). Each sub-lattice contains beads representing and these beads have four turns: {0, 1, 2, 3} at the sub-lattice A
                or {\(\overline{0}, \overline{1}, \overline{2}, \overline{3}\)} at the sub-lattice B. These turns correspond to the relative orientations of the amino acids
                and define the angular displacement between them. Each lattice site or bead in the lattice structure is assigned to either sub-lattice A or B in an alternating manner. This arrangement
                ensures that the lattice structure maintains its periodicity and symmetry. Therefore, in the context of quantum protein folding, the objective is to predict the optimal configuration
                or conformation of a protein by determining the turns of all amino acids. It represents the minimum conformation energy, which is the most stable and
                favorable folded state of the protein. VQE is employed to find the optimal turn which has the minimum conformation energy.
                Note that the quantum protein folding is from the reference [1]. </p>

            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            <p>The objective is to find the optimal configuration which has the minimum conformation energy. It is important to encode the turn by qubits.
            In the denser encoding, each turn between amino acids is represented by two qubits.   </p>
